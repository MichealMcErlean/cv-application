## An Odin Project exercise

Implemented using React + Vite.
Document can switch each section between 'edit' and 'submit' modes, saving input data on each transition.

Very basic React - I figured out a way to better chunk it down into components and dynamically generate the sections just as I was finishing up the initial plan. I'll save those ideas for the next project, I think.
